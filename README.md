## Project Highlights

### Concept/Idea

Our project revolves around the development and deployment of the "denseunet" model, a cutting-edge deep-learning architecture. This model excels in detecting brain tumors by precisely segmenting cancerous cells from brain images, achieving an impressive accuracy of X. The innovative aspect lies in its optimized runtime, surpassing existing solutions in terms of speed and efficiency.

### Speciality/Uniqueness

1. **Accuracy:** The "denseunet" model boasts an exceptional accuracy rate in identifying brain tumors, providing reliable results for medical professionals and researchers.
2. **Optimized Time:** Our solution focuses on delivering results in an optimized timeframe, making it more efficient than current alternatives.
3. **Streamlit Interface:** We have integrated our model into a user-friendly Streamlit interface, allowing users to input MRI images and receive predictions regarding the presence and location of brain tumors.
